# FAQ â€” Frequently Asked Questions

## Q1: Do I need to access real darknet sites?
No. All labs in this course are designed to use simulated or safe environments. You should never access illegal services.

## Q2: Is Tor illegal?
Tor itself is not illegal in most countries. Illegal use of Tor services is what can lead to prosecution.

## Q3: Can I use my personal laptop for labs?
Yes, but only inside a virtual machine with proper isolation. Never use your main OS for darknet experiments.

## Q4: How do I report suspicious darknet findings?
Always use official reporting channels (national CERT, law enforcement). Never attempt vigilante action.
