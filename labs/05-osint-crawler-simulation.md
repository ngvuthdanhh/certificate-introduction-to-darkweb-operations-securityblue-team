# Lab 5 — Building a Safe Metadata Crawler

## Objective
Practice web crawling techniques on **simulated onion-like sites** (local HTML).

## Steps
1. Create 3–4 dummy `.html` pages locally with fake onion-style addresses.
2. Write a Python script with `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` to parse titles and dates.
3. Store results in JSON format.
4. Ensure script avoids downloading files (metadata only).

## Deliverable
Upload JSON file of parsed metadata.
