# Lab 6 â€” Integrating Darknet Indicators into SIEM (Simulated)

## Objective
Practice adding indicators of compromise (IoCs) into SIEM.

## Steps
1. Use dummy IoCs:
   - Onion domains: `examplehiddenservice.onion`
   - Crypto wallets: `1TestBTCWalletXYZ`
2. Insert IoCs into your SIEM (Elastic or Splunk test setup).
3. Create a rule to alert when traffic contains those IoCs.

## Deliverable
Screenshot of SIEM rule firing on dummy IoCs.
