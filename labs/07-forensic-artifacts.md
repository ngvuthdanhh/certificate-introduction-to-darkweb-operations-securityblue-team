# Lab 7 â€” Forensic Artifact Collection

## Objective
Practice collecting artifacts in a controlled VM.

## Steps
1. Use Tor Browser in VM to visit safe, legal pages (e.g., `https://check.torproject.org`).
2. Close the browser.
3. Locate and copy browser cache, cookies, and history databases.
4. Preserve files with SHA256 hashing (`sha256sum`).

## Deliverable
Report with hashes and paths of collected artifacts.
