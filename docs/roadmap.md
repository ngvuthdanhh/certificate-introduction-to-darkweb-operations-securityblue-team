# Roadmap â€” Where to go next

## Post-course tracks
- Threat Intelligence: build pipelines that enrich darknet indicators.
- Digital Forensics: deep-dive into artifact recovery from Tor clients.
- Law & Policy: specialize in cybercrime reporting and cross-border cooperation.

## Suggested next steps
1. Take a formal Threat Intel course (STIX/TAXII, MISP).
2. Practice SIEM rule authoring (Elastic, Splunk) with darknet indicators.
3. Contribute to open-source darknet monitoring projects responsibly.
